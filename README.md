#AIden - Confidently Wrong AI

AIden was created as a hackathon project that uses humor to demonstrate how AI can sound confident even when it is wrong. This project addresses a growing issue: many people rely on AI and often trust its responses without verification. Because AI systems present answers with confidence, users may forget to fact-check information. AIden exposes this risk in a playful but meaningful way, encouraging users to think critically about AI outputs.
